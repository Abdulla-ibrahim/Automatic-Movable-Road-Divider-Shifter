This project introduces a dynamic road divider system that adjusts in real-time to manage traffic efficiently, enhancing urban mobility and reducing congestion.

✪ Features:

✭Dynamic Lane Allocation: Adjusts the number of lanes for ongoing and incoming traffic based on real-time data.
✭Smart Sensors: Uses sensors to monitor traffic density and guide lane adjustments.
✭Emergency Vehicle Detection: Automatically clears lanes for ambulances or other emergency vehicles.

✪ Hardware and Software:

✭Arduino & Embedded C: Code developed using Arduino IDE and Embedded C for real-time traffic management.
✭Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect vehicle proximity and monitor traffic density.
✭Motor Control & LCD Display: Manages road divider movement and displays traffic status.

✪ How to Use the C++ Code:

✭Setup and Initialization: Load the C++ code onto your Arduino through the Arduino IDE. The code handles sensor input, motor control, and display output.
✭Pin Configuration: Ensure proper wiring according to the pin definitions in the code (e.g., sensors, motors, and buzzer).
✭Running the System: Once uploaded, the system automatically monitors traffic, moves the divider, and responds to emergency vehicles. You can view real-time updates on the LCD display.
